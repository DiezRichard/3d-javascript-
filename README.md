# 3d-javascript-

this is an interactive 3d object file (.obj) viewer in javascript.

the zip file contains the project working.

works well with objects with low polygon count.

I imported objects to Prisma3D app, then exported from it,
that way I standardized object files.


this is the first stage of 3d for my game engine.
